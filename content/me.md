Hello and welcome! I'm Tom, a coffee pedant who makes his cut by working as a software engineer in a developer experience team. I found my interest in software engineering by completing [Harvard's CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) during the covid-19 lockdowns in Melbourne. My pedantry with coffee comes from a decade of working in specialty cafes in Melbourne such as [Sibling](https://www.theage.com.au/goodfood/melbourne-eating-out/social-enterprise-cafe-sibling-closes-due-to-tough-economy-20230615-p5dgv7.html).
